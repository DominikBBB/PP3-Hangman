This is my Portfolio Project 3 (PP3) which is a part of the Code Instituteâ€™s Full Stack Software Development Diploma Course. This project demonstrates the skills and knowledge of the Python Programming Language which I have learned during the course.
The project purpose is to build a command-line python application that allows user to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.

# Project Overview:

The Hangman Game is a very popular world game. In this application, the user is asked to input their name, and then a random secret word is choosen from a list of words. The user has to guess the word by inputting letters one at a time. If the letter is in the word, it is revealed, but if it is not, the player is penalized with an additional body part in the gallows. If the user correctly guesses full word, the app will ask the player if they want to try to be hanged  again. If the player does not guess the word correctly within the allowed number of guesses, the app will reveal the answer and ask the player if they want to be hanged again. The user has 7 lifes. The application is very easy to navigate for anybody.
