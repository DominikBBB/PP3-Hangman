This is my Portfolio Project 3 (PP3) which is a part of the Code Instituteâ€™s Full Stack Software Development Diploma Course. This project demonstrates the skills and knowledge of the Python Programming Language which I have learned during the course.
The project purpose is to build a command-line python application that allows user to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.

# Project Overview:

The Hangman Game is a very popular world game. In this application, the user is asked to input their name, and then a random secret word is choosen from a list of words. The user has to guess the word by inputting letters one at a time. If the letter is in the word, it is revealed, but if it is not, the player is penalized with an additional body part in the gallows. If the user correctly guesses full word, the app will ask the player if they want to try to be hanged  again. If the player does not guess the word correctly within the allowed number of guesses, the app will reveal the answer and ask the player if they want to be hanged again. The user has 7 lifes. The application is very easy to navigate for anybody.

# Testing:

## Validation:


   [CI-Python-Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used to check the code for errors. Code passed validation in all files. Only warning 'W605 invalid escape sequence "\" ' showed up related to the hangman ascii art code which doesn't effect working code. Attempts to resolve the warning ended unsucesful.

   [Validation](assets/testing/pep8/VALIDATION.md)
   

   
## Funcionality Testing:


   The functional final test was carried out using a flowchart. All works as expected. No bugs found.

   [Functional testing](assets/testing/manual/FUNCIONAL.md)


## User Stories Testing:


   1. I would like the game to be easy to navigate.

        There is implemented a simple and clear user interface that guide the user through the game.

   2. I would like to easily understand the rules.

        There are clear and concise instructions provided at the beginning of the game.

   3. I would like to enter my name.

        User puts their name after he decided to play the game. In the meantime, he is informed that his gallows is building up.

   4. I would like to be warmed if I put incorrent character.

        There is an error messages and visual cues to indicate that there has been an error. the user is prompt to input correct data before continuing.

   5. I would like to track the game progress.

        There is a meter of 'wrong letters', 'guesses left' and progress of the gallow.

   6. I would like to have a chance to retake the game.

        The user is clearly asked at the end of the game if he wants to play again or exit program.

   7. I want to make that game with user-friendly and intuitive navigation.

        Terminal has black background. Letters are white, red and yellow. High contrast makes all options, commands well seen and easy to navigate.

   8. I want to make sure that the game rules are easily to understand.

        Four Game Golden Rules are short and easy to understand.

   9. I want to ensure the game level is average enough to prevent any user from becoming bored.

        Secret words are animals names and each consists of 4 letters. In future features, the user will be able to choose level of difficulty, and enter his own word.

   10. I want user to be able to choose to play again or exit.
        
        The user is clearly asked at the end of the game if he wants to play again or exit program.

7. Click 'Save',
8. You will be prompted with a URL to your deployed site,
9. Site deployed.

When the above steps have been completed, it can sometimes take a moment for the deployed URL to update. It is enough to refresh the page until the site is fully deployed.


## Forking The GitHub Repository:

To use this code and make changes without affecting the original code you can do what is called 'Forking the repository'. By forking this repository you are given a copy of the code at that moment in time that you can use freely. To fork this repository you need to follow the following few steps:

1. Log into your GitHub account,
2. Navigate to the [Repository](https://github.com/DominikBBB/PP3-Hangman), you are willing to fork,
3. In the upper-right of the repository, click the 'Fork' button,
4. A copy of the Repository will now be available within your repositories.

You will now have a copy of the code available to clone and work on without affecting the original code.


## Cloning the Project:

To make a local clone of the project follow these steps:

1. Log into your GitHub account.
2. Navigate to the [Repository](https://github.com/DominikBBB/PP3-Hangman),
3. In the upper section of the repository click the drop-down named 'Code',

5. Open GitBash,
6. Navigate to the correct directory,
7. Create a new directory named 'PP3-Hangman-Clone',
8. CD into 'PP3-Hangman-Clone',
9. Enter 'git clone SSH_ADDRESS',
